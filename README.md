# TVS CREDIT E.I.P.C SEASON 5, IT CHALLENGE - RISK EVALUATION AND UNDERMINING SOFTWARE SOLUTION
## Introduction
We propose to develop an AI-powered blockchain-based mobile application that will help TVS Credit to assess the risk of borrowers more accurately. This app collects essential borrower data, such as credit scores, income, and debt-to-income ratios, alongside non-traditional data in the form of a personality assessment test to anticipate financial behavior and risk tolerance levels.

An advanced ML model is then employed to determine whether an applicant qualifies as a low-risk candidate based on both traditional and non-traditional data. Notably, all borrower information will be securely stored in a decentralized blockchain network, ensuring the utmost security and privacy.

The app features user-friendly customer service assisted by automated systems and live human interaction to help loan borrowers clear doubts regarding the process, etc. Furthermore, this application goes beyond risk assessment by offering personalized risk mitigation guidance through customer service. This approach encompasses financial education and tailored recommendations aimed at improving the borrower's financial well-being. By adopting a proactive stance, the application empowers borrowers to progressively diminish their risk profile over time.
